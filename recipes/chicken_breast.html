        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the grill: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If you're using a gas grill, preheat it to 400
            degrees F (200 degrees C). If you're using a charcoal grill, let the coals burn until they're covered with a white ash.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grill the chicken: Place the chicken on the grill and cook for 6-7 minutes per side, or until the internal
            temperature reaches 165 degrees F (75 degrees C). The chicken should be golden brown and have grill marks on
            both sides.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rest: Remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving. This will allow the
            juices to redistribute and the chicken to finish cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve: Slice the chicken and serve it with your favorite side dishes, such as grilled vegetables, rice, or
            salad.
